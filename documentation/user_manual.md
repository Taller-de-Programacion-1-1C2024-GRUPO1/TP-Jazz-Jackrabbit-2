| <img src=utils_png/crab.png style="width:70%;"> | Watch out for Mr. Crab, scuttling sideways with those big, menacing claws! The crab is small and fast, making it a nimble adversary. If you accidentally step on him, he'll give you a "friendly" pinch, just to say hello! |
| <img src=utils_png/lizard.png style="width:70%;"> | Here comes the lazy lizard, it might seem harmless but be careful not to bump into it, though, it's not the friendliest of creatures! Keep your distance and take it out before it gets too close! |
| <img src=utils_png/turtle.png style="width:70%;"> | The turtle is a tough nut to crack with its high health. It moves slowly, but don’t be fooled by its pace. If you touch the turtle, it will take away some of your health. Approach with caution and be ready to chip away at its defenses! |

### Drops

#### Weapons and Ammo

Perfect for dealing with multiple enemies at once, the flamethrower turns up the heat and leaves a trail of destruction. Just hold down the trigger and watch your foes burn! |
| ![IMG](utils_png/raygun.png) | The raygun packs a powerful punch in a short-range blast. This high-tech weapon delivers a burst of energy that does a lot of damage, making it ideal for close encounters. When enemies get too close for comfort, the raygun's intense firepower ensures they won't stay there for long. |
| ![IMG](utils_png/rocketlauncher.png) | For those who prefer to take out enemies from a distance, the rocket launcher is the perfect choice. This long-range weapon deals a significant amount of damage, allowing you to pick off foes before they even know what's hit them. With pinpoint accuracy and devastating power, the rocke launcher turns you into a lethal sharpshooter. |

#### Food

Enemies don't just leave the battlefield empty-handed! As you defeat them, they may drop various types of food that not only provide points but also offer special benefits. 

However, **be cautious**: not all food is created equal! `Carrots`, for example, not only give you points but also restore your health, providing extra hearts to keep you going. But watch out for the `Rotten cheese` - rabbits don't like it! If you accidentally eat rotten cheese, it can damage and stun you, leaving you vulnerable to enemy attacks. So, while collecting food can boost your score and keep you healthy, make sure to avoid the spoiled snacks that might turn the tide against you!

## Items

Now, there are three ways the party can wrap up:
