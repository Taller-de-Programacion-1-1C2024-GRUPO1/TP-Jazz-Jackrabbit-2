# Jazz Jackrabbit 2 - Taller de Programación (75.42) - Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Buenos Aires

This project is the final group assignment for the subject 'Taller de Programación' (course code 75.42) at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires. The aim of the project is to implement a functional and comprehensive version of the classic game Jazz Jackrabbit 2 using modern programming techniques and tools learned during the course such as Sockets and Threads. The project focuses on collaborative development, problem-solving, and practical application of software engineering principles.

### Installation and Usage

> ⚠️ **WARNING THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA** ⚠️

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Taller-de-Programacion-1-1C2024-GRUPO1/TP-Jazz-Jackrabbit-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd TP-Jazz-Jackrabbit-2
   ```
3. **Install all the dependencies**:
   ```
   chmod +x install_all.sh
   sudo ./install_all.sh
   ```
4. **Build the game**:
   ```
   chmod +x run_all.sh
   sudo ./run_all.sh
   ```
4. **Run the game**:
   > **NOTE**: You need to open two terminals - one dedicated to running the server and another for the client.

   *Start the Server*:
   ```
   jazz_server <port>
   ```
   Replace `<port>` with the port number you want to use for the server, e.g., `jazz_server 8080`.

   *Start a Client*:
   > **NOTE**: For each new player, you will need to open a new terminal and start a new client.
   ```
   jazz_client <host> <port>
   ```
   Replace `<host>` with the hostname or IP address of the server you want to connect to, and `<port>` with the port number used by the server, e.g., `jazz_client localhost 8080`.

-----------------
### Create or edit a map
After building the game, if you want to create a new map and play with it, you will have to start the client from the `build` folder. 
```
   cd build
   ./jazz_client <host> <port>
```
Replace `<host>` with the hostname or IP address of the server you want to connect to, and `<port>` with the port number used by the server, e.g., `jazz_client localhost 8080`.

-----------------
### Testing
After building the game, to run the tests you will have to execute:
```
./run_tests.sh
```
